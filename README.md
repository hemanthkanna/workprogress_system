db.Sequelize = Sequelize;

are assigning references to the Sequelize constructor and the created Sequelize instance (sequelizeInstance) to properties of the db object.

db.Sequelize = Sequelize;   
   : This line assigns the reference to the Sequelize constructor to the Sequelize property of the db object. This allows access to the Sequelize constructor throughout the application via the db object.

db.sequelizeInstance = sequelizeInstance;
   : This line assigns the reference to the created Sequelize   instance (sequelizeInstance) to the sequelizeInstance property of the db object. This allows access to the initialized Sequelize instance throughout the application via the db object.

By doing this, the db object effectively becomes a container for both the Sequelize constructor and the initialized Sequelize instance, making them accessible and reusable in other parts of the application by importing the db object.
